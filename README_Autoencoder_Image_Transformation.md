# Autoencoder for Image Transformation

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based autoencoder to transform a single input image into different output images. The objective is to use unsupervised learning techniques for feature extraction and image reconstruction while exploring the versatility of autoencoders in generating diverse output images.

## Features
- **Input Image Encoding:** Compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Image Reconstruction:** Reconstructs the input image from the encoded latent representation.
- **Output Variability:** Generates multiple output images based on variations in the latent space.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image preprocessing)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autoencoder-image-transformation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd autoencoder-image-transformation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ANN_2_Auto_encode_single_image_to_different_image.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Preprocess the input image.
   - Train the autoencoder model.
   - Generate transformed output images.

3. Modify the latent space inputs in the notebook to explore different output variations.

## File Structure
- `ANN_2_Auto_encode_single_image_to_different_image.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Results
Include a section in the notebook or this README to display example input images and their corresponding output transformations.

## Future Work
- Extend the model to support batch processing of images.
- Experiment with different autoencoder architectures.
- Add support for GAN-based transformations.
